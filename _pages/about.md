Hi, I'm Heewoong Noh..
I'm a master student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm currently engaged in research activities alongside my great colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).


<!-- Nowadays, the amount of data that is generated every minute in the world makes it challenging to locate the values we require.
Therefore, it is essential to automatically extract knowledge from real-world data and create AI solutions for a variety of real-world applications from many disciplines.

Among the various data structures, I'm mainly interested in a graph structure, which is simple yet effective to represent complex relationships in reality. -->
In the vast field of machine learning, my primary focus is to harness the potential of AI to address challenges in the domain of science.
- AI4Science (Chemistry)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chemistry domain 
- Multi-modal Learning

<!-- My research spans across areas such as AI for Science (Chemistry), the utilization Large Language Models and Multi-Modal Learning." -->
